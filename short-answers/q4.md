# Question
When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

We would want to use `.innerHTML` when we need to overwrite previous HTML. We want to use `.createElement` when we want our elements to be dynamic in the content they hold.
